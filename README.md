**# my_todo_list_app**

This repository contains a Django project that implements a todo list application with user authentication. The application provides features like user registration, login, and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality for managing todo items.

**Features:**

1. User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their username, email, and password. The registration process includes validation to ensure the username and email are unique.

2. Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their username and password. The authentication system securely stores passwords using hashing techniques.

3. Todo List: Once logged in, users can create, view, update, and delete todo items. Each item contains a title, description, status, and due date.
